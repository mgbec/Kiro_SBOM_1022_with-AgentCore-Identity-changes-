# SBOM Security Agent - User Guide

## What is the SBOM Security Agent?

The SBOM Security Agent is like a **security inspector for your software projects**. It automatically examines your code repositories (where your software is stored) and creates detailed reports about:

- **What components your software uses** (like ingredients in a recipe)
- **Security vulnerabilities** (potential security problems)
- **Recommendations** for keeping your software safe

Think of it as getting a comprehensive health check-up for your software projects.

## What You'll Get

### üìã Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
A detailed list of all the software components your project uses, like:
- Third-party libraries and packages
- Version numbers
- Licenses
- Where they came from

### üîç Security Analysis
- Identification of known security vulnerabilities
- Risk assessment with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Clear explanations of what each vulnerability means

### üìä Executive Reports
- Professional summaries suitable for management
- Compliance status for security standards
- Action plans with priorities and timelines

## How to Use the Agent

### Step 1: Start a Conversation
Simply talk to the agent in natural language. Here are some examples:

**"Analyze my repository for security issues"**
- The agent will ask for your GitHub repository URL
- It will guide you through authentication if needed
- Then perform a complete security analysis

**"Generate an SBOM report for https://github.com/mycompany/myproject"**
- Creates a detailed software bill of materials
- Available in industry-standard formats (SPDX, CycloneDX)

**"What security vulnerabilities does my project have?"**
- Scans all dependencies for known security issues
- Provides detailed vulnerability information
- Suggests remediation steps

### Step 2: Authentication (First Time Only)
When you first use the agent:

1. **The agent will provide a special link**
2. **Click the link** - it opens GitHub in your browser
3. **Sign in to GitHub** if you're not already signed in
4. **Click "Authorize"** to give the agent permission to read your repositories
5. **Return to the agent** - it will automatically continue

**What permissions does the agent need?**
- Read access to your repositories (to analyze the code)
- Read your basic profile information
- The agent **cannot** modify your code or repositories

### Step 3: Choose Your Repository
You can analyze any GitHub repository by providing:
- **Public repositories**: Just provide the URL
- **Private repositories**: You need to own them or have access
- **Organization repositories**: You need appropriate permissions

**Example URLs:**
- `https://github.com/username/project-name`
- `github.com/company/internal-project`
- Just the repository name if it's obvious from context

### Step 4: Review Results
The agent provides results in real-time:

1. **Progress Updates**: See what's happening as the analysis runs
2. **Summary**: Quick overview of findings
3. **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive analysis with recommendations
4. **Export Options**: Download reports in various formats

## Understanding Your Results

### üö® Vulnerability Severity Levels

**üî¥ Critical (Immediate Action Required)**
- Severe security flaws that could be easily exploited
- **Action**: Fix immediately (within 24 hours)
- **Example**: Remote code execution vulnerabilities

**üü† High (Urgent - Fix Within 1 Week)**
- Serious security issues that pose significant risk
- **Action**: Prioritize and fix quickly
- **Example**: Authentication bypass vulnerabilities

**üü° Medium (Important - Fix Within 1 Month)**
- Moderate security concerns
- **Action**: Plan fixes in next development cycle
- **Example**: Information disclosure issues

**üü¢ Low (Monitor and Plan)**
- Minor security issues or best practice violations
- **Action**: Address when convenient
- **Example**: Outdated dependencies with no known exploits

### üìä Risk Score
- **0-20**: Low risk - Good security posture
- **21-50**: Moderate risk - Some attention needed
- **51-80**: High risk - Significant security concerns
- **81-100**: Critical risk - Immediate action required

## Common Questions

### "What if I don't understand the technical details?"
The agent provides explanations at different levels:
- **Executive summaries** for management decisions
- **Technical details** for development teams
- **Action plans** with clear next steps

### "Is my code safe with this agent?"
Yes! The agent:
- Only **reads** your code, never modifies it
- Analyzes dependencies, not your proprietary code
- Uses secure, encrypted connections
- Follows enterprise security standards

### "How often should I run this analysis?"
**Recommended frequency:**
- **New projects**: Before first release
- **Active development**: Weekly or bi-weekly
- **Production systems**: Monthly
- **After major updates**: Always
- **When security alerts are published**: As needed

### "What if the agent finds many vulnerabilities?"
Don't panic! This is normal and helpful:

1. **Focus on Critical and High severity first**
2. **Many vulnerabilities have simple fixes** (updating versions)
3. **The agent provides step-by-step remediation guidance**
4. **Not all vulnerabilities affect your specific use case**

### "Can I share these reports?"
Yes! The reports are designed for sharing:
- **Executive summaries** for leadership and stakeholders
- **Technical reports** for development and security teams
- **Compliance reports** for auditors and regulators
- **Export formats** suitable for different audiences

## Sample Conversations

### Basic Security Check
**You:** "Check my project for security issues"
**Agent:** "I'd be happy to help! Please provide your GitHub repository URL."
**You:** "https://github.com/mycompany/webapp"
**Agent:** *Performs authentication and analysis*
**Result:** Complete security report with vulnerabilities and recommendations

### SBOM Generation
**You:** "I need a software bill of materials for compliance"
**Agent:** "I can generate SBOM reports in industry-standard formats. Which repository would you like me to analyze?"
**You:** "Our main product repository: github.com/company/product"
**Agent:** *Creates SPDX and CycloneDX format SBOMs*
**Result:** Professional SBOM documents ready for compliance submission

### Executive Reporting
**You:** "Create an executive summary of our security posture"
**Agent:** "I'll analyze your repository and create a management-ready security summary. Please provide the repository URL."
**Result:** Executive summary with risk assessment, compliance status, and strategic recommendations

## Getting Help

### If Something Goes Wrong
1. **Authentication issues**: Try the authorization process again
2. **Repository not found**: Check the URL and your access permissions
3. **Analysis fails**: The agent will explain what went wrong and suggest solutions
